# The Gaming Room - Software Design Document

## Client Overview
The client for this project was **The Gaming Room**, a company that wanted to expand their existing game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a cross-platform web-based application. Their primary requirement was a scalable, distributed system that could support multiple instances of the game, each containing unique teams and players. The client wanted the system to manage memory and resources efficiently while maintaining smooth performance.

## Reflection

**What did I do well in the documentation?**  
I did a good job of clearly identifying the client’s needs and translating them into specific software requirements. I also structured the design document in a way that made it easy for both technical and non-technical readers to understand.

**What part of the process was helpful?**  
Working through the design document helped me break down a large project into smaller, more manageable components. By thinking through the architecture and requirements first, the actual coding process felt more organized and efficient.

**What would I revise if I could?**  
If I had more time, I would expand on the security considerations. While I touched on authentication and authorization, I could improve by detailing more advanced approaches such as token-based authentication and role-based access control.

**How did I interpret user needs and implement them?**  
I focused on ensuring that users would have a seamless experience regardless of their operating system. By prioritizing cross-platform compatibility and scalability, the design addressed both the client’s business goals and the players’ usability needs. Considering user needs is crucial because software ultimately succeeds or fails based on how well it serves its end users.

**How did I approach designing the software?**  
I used an iterative design process: first analyzing the client requirements, then mapping them to system constraints, and finally outlining the architectural approach. In the future, I would continue using this approach but also incorporate UML diagrams earlier in the process to visualize the system’s structure more effectively.
